# Made by Nothing

> A design series reimagining popular websites through the lens of Nothing's minimalist design philosophy.

## 🎯 About

**Made by Nothing** is an ongoing design exploration series where I reimagine well-known digital products using Nothing's distinctive design language. Each project in this series challenges conventional UI patterns and embraces the bold minimalism, dot matrix aesthetics, and red accent philosophy that defines Nothing's brand identity.

### Design Philosophy

- **Minimalism First**: Strip away unnecessary elements, focus on what matters
- **Monochromatic Base**: Black, white, and shades of gray dominate the palette
- **Strategic Red Accents**: Red used sparingly for emphasis and interaction
- **Dot Matrix Typography**: Inspired by Nothing's iconic Glyph interface
- **Clean Geometry**: Sharp edges, precise spacing, intentional whitespace
- **Dark Mode Native**: Designed for OLED displays with true blacks
